[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/creativeaura/generator-initium.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/creativeaura/generator-initium)

A generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?



```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-initium from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-initium
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo initium
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
